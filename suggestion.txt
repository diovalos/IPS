🖼️ Suggestion for PPT 

Add a slide titled:
"ESP32: Wi-Fi Scanning & Distance Estimation Code"
→ Show a snippet of the estimateDistance() function
→ Explain: "Distance is calculated using RSSI and calibrated path loss model" 


-> in the latest commit i havent updated the offset , i have to check about the foltering part and the averaging is also not considered
